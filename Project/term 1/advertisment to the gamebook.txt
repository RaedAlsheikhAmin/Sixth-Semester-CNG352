Imagine a one-stop gaming hub where you can effortlessly browse through all your favorite games from different stores like Steam, EA, and Epic Games, all with just a single click. But wait, there's more! You can add friends, curate your own personalized game preferences, and even get recommendations for similar games based on your playtime. How does it work? Well, if you've sunk at least 10 hours into a game, you can recommend it to others. And if you've clocked in a solid 15 hours each on two games, you'll get recommendations for similar titles. Plus, we're not stopping there â€“ our Gamebook application will also foster a vibrant gaming community where users can ask questions, share tips, and troubleshoot problems together. And the best part? It's all powered by PHP and MySQL, making it accessible and user-friendly for gamers of all levels. So, are you ready to level up your gaming experience?
